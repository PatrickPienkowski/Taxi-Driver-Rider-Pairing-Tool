This is a project completed in CSC148 via Python. It was an individual project that focused on using object-orientated programming.

The goal of the project was to match up drivers and riders in the most effecient way in order for each rider to get a driver if possible.
The program contains 4 main aspects, riders, drivers, dispatcher and monitor.
The rider can request a trip to a certain destination. The driver can request for a rider via dispatch.
The rider can request a ride or cancel if the wait is too long. The driver can log in and log out, to show dispatch they are available for work. The location of the driver/rider
is being updated to dispatch to ensure fastest travel available.
The monitor.py program keeps track of data and statistics throughout the simulation to find different analytics including driver earnings and rider wait time.
